## Fake News Classification


In this project we are given two csv file, train.csv and test.csv with the following attributes:
  ▪ Id: the id of each news pair
  ▪ tid1: the id of fake news tittle 1
  ▪ tid2: the id of news title 2
  ▪ title1_en: the fake news title 1 in English
  ▪ title2_en: the fake news title 2 in English
  ▪ label: indicates the relation between the news pair: agree/disagree/unrelated
Additionally, the task is defined as follows, Given the title of a fake news article A and the title of a coming news article B, participants are asked to classify B into one of the three categories
The objective of the project is to find the test labels, map them with the test ids and save them in a csv file. Further, the results for validation are stored as well.
